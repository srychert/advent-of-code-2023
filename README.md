# Adevent of code 2023

## What is this project?

This project contains solutions written in go programming language for each day\* of [advent of code 2023 edition](https://adventofcode.com/2023). I made it for the purpose of learning more about go and to have some fun :D.

\* <small>At the time of writing this readme file, not all days have a solution yet.</small>

## Prerequisites

Go version 1.22.1 or higher

## Run project

You can run a solution for each day by using the `make dayX` command where **X** is the day number (1-25). Each day has its own `input.txt` file that is used to calculate the answer.
